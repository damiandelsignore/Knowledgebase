# Knowledgebase

This is code from my internship during the summer of 2016 at OpenSymmetry. Prior to starting this internship, I had no experience in JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I used all of those frequently, and am now at an intermediate proficiency in all of them. I am also adding, committing, and pushing this through the terminal.
